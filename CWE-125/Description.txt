The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash.
A crash can occur when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists to stop the read operation, such as a NULL in a string.
The expected sentinel might not be located in the out-of-bounds memory, causing excessive data to be read, leading to a segmentation fault or a buffer overflow.
The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer.
A subsequent read operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.
