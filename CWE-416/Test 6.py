list = [42]
del list
list[0] = 13  # Use-After-Free vulnerability
# This code demonstrates a Use-After-Free vulnerability in Python. 
# The code creates a list and adds an element to it. 
# The code then deletes the list using the del statement, which frees the memory used by the list. 
# However, the code then continues to access the memory by assigning the value 13 to the first element of the list. 
# This results in a Use-After-Free vulnerability, as the program is accessing memory that has already been freed.
